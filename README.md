# Data Structures And Algorithms
This repo is created to help me and other students learn more about different types of Data Structures and Algorithms. When programming the different types of data structures and algorithms, I will be using two different programming languages: C++ and Python.

The following algorithms have been completed:


# Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithms     | C++                | Python               | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Bubble Sort    | :heavy_check_mark: |  :heavy_check_mark:  | O(n<sup>2</sup>)|     O(1)         |
| Merge Sort     | :heavy_check_mark: |  :heavy_check_mark:  | O(n log n)      |     O(n)         |
| Insertion Sort | :heavy_check_mark: |  :heavy_check_mark:  | O(n<sup>2</sup>)|   O(1)           |
| Selection Sort | :heavy_check_mark: |  :heavy_check_mark:  | O(n<sup>2</sup>)|   O(1)           |
| Quick Sort     | :heavy_check_mark: |  :heavy_check_mark:  | O(n<sup>2</sup>)<sup>*</sup>      |  O(log n)          |

\* Although the time complexity for Quick Sort is  O(n<sup>2</sup>), if the pivots are chosen properly, the time complexity can become O(n log n).

# Sorting Algorithms Explanations (Pros, Cons, Potential uses)

1. Bubble Sort
    * Easy to understand and implement.
    * Very little use of memory as sorting takes place within array or list.
    * Extremely inefficient. O(n<sup>2</sup>) Time Complexity.
    * Performs more comparisons and swaps compared to other sorting algorithms.
2. Merge Sort
      * Complex compared to other algorithms and utilizes recursion
      * Extremely efficient in terms of time complexity
      * However, O(n) space complexity due to creating a new array that is sorted with length n which means additional memory is required.
3. Insertion Sort
4. Selection Sort
5. Quick Sort


# Search Algorithms

| Algorithms     | C++                | Python               | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Binary Search  | :heavy_check_mark: |  :heavy_check_mark:  | O(log n)        |     O(1)         |

# Data Structures

| Data Structures    | C++                | Python           | Access | Search | Insertion | Deletion|
|----------------|--------------------|----------------------|--------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Linked List  |  |   |  |  |  |  |
| Hash Table  |   |   |  |  |  |  |
| Binary Tree  |   |   |  |  |  |  |

When time permits, more algorithms and data structures will be discussed.
