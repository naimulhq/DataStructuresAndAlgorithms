# Data Structures And Algorithms
This repo is created to help me and other students learn more about different types of Data Structures and Algorithms. When programming the different types of data structures and algorithms, I will be using two different programming languages: C++ and Python.

The following algorithms have been completed:


# Sorting Algorithms

| Algorithms     | C++                | Python               | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Bubble Sort    | :heavy_check_mark: |  :heavy_check_mark:  | O(n<sup>2</sup>)|     O(1)         |
| Merge Sort     | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:   | O(n log n)      |     O(n)         |
| Insertion Sort |  |   |       |            |
| Quick Sort     |  |    |       |            |
